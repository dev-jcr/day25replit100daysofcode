# 👉 Day 25 Challenge

Let's extend Day 24's project and create a health stats generator for a character in a video game.

1. Create a subroutine that rolls a dice of any size and returns that number.
2. Then, create a second subroutine that rolls one six-sided dice and one eight-sided dice. 
3. Multiply the number from the six-sided dice and eight-sided dice together and return that subroutine as a character's health stats for a video game.
4. Print out the character's health stats.
5. Add a loop to give the user the option to generate health stats for another character.

(We genuinely see this in video games!)

🥳 Extra points if you ask for the character's name and double extra points if you use different colors!

<details> <summary> 💡 Hints </summary>
  
- Import your library first.
- Create one subroutine for a dice of any number and `return` it.
- Create a subroutine that rolls a dice with numbers 1-6 and a dice with numbers 1-8 and multiplies the two numbers together. `Return` that subroutine.
- Ask the user to name their character and `print` that character's health stats.
- Create a `while` loop to allow the user to generate a new character's health stats.
